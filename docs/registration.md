## Tests vs Sessions

You will be redirected to the starting page where you will be asked to select one of the two screen modes: **Integration via agent (Tests)** or **Selenium Hub (Sessions).** This view will be displayed by default when you open the **Test runs/Test sessions** page.

If you skip this step, **Integration via agent (Test runs view)** will be enabled by default. You can easily switch between the 2 modes by using the control on the Test runs/Test sessions page.

### Tests: Integration via agent

If you choose this mode, you need to integrate Zebrunner Agent into your automation framework. 

The agent allows to track test results in real time, apply detailed configuration and publish artifacts within one tool.

**This mode provides:**

* Video recordings
* Session logs
* Known issues tracking
* Test artifacts

This mode requires integration via the client library that you can find in our regional GitHub repositories.

### Sessions: Selenium Hub

This is the easiest way to run tests in Zebrunner infrastructure. You need to generate an access token and configure your tests to use Zebrunner Selenium URL.

**This mode provides:**

* Real-time test sessions tracking
* Video recordings
* Session logs
